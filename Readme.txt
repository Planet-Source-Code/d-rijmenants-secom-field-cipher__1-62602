 SECOM v1.0 Read me


 *** DESCRIPTION ***

 The SECOM handcipher is used to encipher messages by hand. The SECOM
 program is a fast methode to encipher or decipher these messages.

 SECOM uses a 20 letter key phrase to generate the settings for a
 straddling checherboard, a normal and a disrupted transposition.
 The combination of fractioning by the checkerboard and the double
 disrupted transposition makes SECOM a higly secure encryption methode.


 *** HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM ***

 In the text box you can enter a text, containing letters, numbers and
 spaces. All other characters will be ignored. Line feeds in the text
 bow will be replaced by a space. Message lenght is  limited to
 10,000 characters. However, it is adviced to use no more than e few
 hundred characters, to make manual deciphering possible and make
 cryptanalysis more difficult.

 The key phrase must contain at least 20 letter - more letters will be
 ignored - and may include spaces between the 20 letters.

 To encipher a message, just select the Encode menu. After enciphering,
 the number groups will appear. You can select on the bottom of the 
 program how many groups are displayed on one line.

 To decipher a message, enter the number groups, enter the correct key
 phrase and select the Decode menu. Beware that during enciphering,
 nulls can be added to complete a 5 digit group. These should be 
 disgarded after deciphering. To exclude reading errors at the end of
 the message, it is adviced to use XXX at the end of a message.


 If an error is made, you can select the Undo menu (only once).


 *** USING THE PAPER VERSION ***

 Ofcourse, the primary purpose of SECOM is to encipher messages
 by hand. Select the 'Paper Version' menu to display the instructions
 for manual use of the SECOM cipher.
